## Problem 1
To run the code for problem 1 following packages are needed: 
>python3,  OpenCV,  numpy, matplotlib, scipy.spatial.transform, itertools

### Steps to run the code: 

1. Place the files **python3 vsingh03_project2_1.py** and **project2.avi** in same folder
2. On the terminal change the directory where above two files are placed. 
3. Run the below command. This will run the code. The results will be displayed on terminal, graphs on separate window.

`python3 vsingh03_project2_1.py`
